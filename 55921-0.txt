COME WHOAM TO THI CHILDER AN’ ME.


    Aw’ve just mended th’ fire wi’ a cob;
      Owd Swaddle has brought thi new shoon;
    There’s some nice bacon collops o’th hob,
      An’ a quart o’ ale-posset i’th oon;
    Aw’ve brought thi top cwot, doesto know,
      For th’ rain’s comin’ deawn very dree;
    An’ th’ har’stone’s as white as new snow;
      Come whoam to thi childer an’ me.

    When aw put little Sally to bed,
      Hoo cried ’cose her feyther weren’t theer;
    So aw kiss’d th’ little thing, an’ aw said
      Thae’d bring her a ribbin fro’ th’ fair;
    An’ aw gav her her doll, an’ some rags,
      An’ a nice little white cotton bo’;
    An’ aw kiss’d her again; but hoo said
      At hoo wanted to kiss _thee_ an’ o’.

    An’ Dick, too, aw’d sich wark wi’ him,
      Afore aw could get him up stairs;
    Thae towd him thae’d bring him a drum,
      He said, when he’re sayin’ his prayers;
    Then he look’d i’ my face, an’ he said,
      “Has th’ boggarts taen houd o’ my dad?”
    An’ he cried whol his e’en were quite red;—
      He likes thee some weel, does yon lad!

    At th’ lung-length aw geet ’em laid still;
      An’ aw hearken’t folks’ feet at went by;
    So aw iron’t o’ my clooas reet weel,
      An’ aw hanged ’em o’th maiden to dry;
    When aw’d mended thi stockin’s an’ shirts,
      Aw sit deawn to knit i’ my cheer,
    An’ aw rayley did feel rather hurt—
      Mon, aw’m _one-ly_ when theaw art’nt theer.

    “Aw’ve a drum and a trumpet for Dick;
      Aw’ve a yard o’ blue ribbin for Sal;
    Aw’ve a book full o’ babs; an’ a stick,
      An’ some bacco an’ pipes for mysel;
    Aw’ve brought thee some coffee an’ tay—
      Iv thae’ll _feel_ i’ my pocket, thae’ll _see_;
    An’ aw’ve bought tho a new cap to-day,—
      But aw olez bring summat for _thee_!

    “God bless tho, my lass; aw’ll go whoam,
      An’ aw’ll kiss thee an’ th’ childer o’ reawnd;
    Thae knows, at wheerever aw roam,
      Aw’m fain to get back to th’ owd greawnd;
    Aw can do wi’ a crack o’er a glass;
      Aw can do wi’ a bit ov a spree;
    But aw’ve no gradely comfort, my lass,
      Except wi’ yon childer and thee.”

WHAT AILS THEE, MY SON ROBIN?


    What ails thee, my son Robin?
      My heart is sore for thee;
    Thi cheeks are grooin’ thinner,
      An’ th’ leet has laft thi e’e;
    Theaw trails abeawt so lonesome,
      An’ looks so pale at morn;
    God bless tho, lad, aw’m soory
      To see tho so forlorn.

    Thi fuutstep’s sadly awter’t,—
      Aw used to know it weel;
    Neaw, arto fairy-strucken;
      Or, arto gradely ill?
    Or, hasto bin wi’ th’ witches
      I’th’ cloof, at deep o’th’ neet?
    Come, tell mo, Robin, tell mo,
      For summat is not reet!

    “Neaw, mother, dunnot fret yo;
      Aw am not like mysel’;
    But, ’tis not lung o’th’ feeorin’
      That han to do wi’th deil;
    There’s nought at thus could daunt mo,
      I’th’ cloof, by neet nor day;—
    It’s yon blue e’en o’ Mary’s;—
      They taen my life away.

    “Aw deawt aw’ve done wi comfort
      To th’ day that aw mun dee;
    For th’ place hoo sets her fuut on,
      It’s fairy greawnd to me;
    But oh, it’s useless speighkin’,
      Aw connut ston her pride;
    An’ when a true heart’s breighkin
      It’s very hard to bide!”

    Neaw God be wi’ tho, Robin;
      Just let her have her way;
    Hoo’ll never meet thy marrow,
      For mony a summer day!
    Aw’re just same wi’ thi feyther,
      When first he spoke to me:
    So, go thi ways, an’ whistle;
      An’ th’ lass’ll come to thee!

GOD BLESS THESE POOR FOLK!


    God bless these poor folk that are strivin’
      By means that are honest an’ true,
    For something to keep ’em alive in
      This world ’at we’re scramblin’ through;
    As th’ life ov a mon’s full o’ feightin’,
      A poor soul that wants to feight fair,
    Should never be grudged ov his heytin’,
      For th’ hardest o’th battle’s his share.

          _Chorus._—As th’ life ov a mon.

    This world’s kin to trouble; i’th best on’t,
      There’s mony sad changes come reawnd;
    We wandern abeawt to find rest on’t,
      An’ th’ worm yammers for us i’th’ greawnd;
    May he that’ll wortch while he’s able,
      Be never long hungry nor dry;
    An’ th’ childer ’at sit at his table,—
      God bless’ em wi’ plenty, say I.

          _Chorus._—As th’ life ov a mon.

    An’ he that can feel it a pleasur’
      To leeten misfortin an’ pain,—
    May his pantry be olez full measur’,
      To cut at, and come to again;
    May God bless his cup and his cupbort,
      A theawsan for one that he gives;
    An’ his heart be a bumper o’ comfort,
      To th’ very last minute he lives!

          _Chorus._—As th’ life ov a mon.

    An’ he that scorns ale to his victual,
      Is welcome to let it alone;
    There’s some can be wise with a little,
      An’ some that are foolish wi’ noan;
    An’ some are so quare i’ their natur’
      That nought wi’ their stomachs agree;
    But, he that would liefer drink wayter,
      Shall never be stinted by me.

          _Chorus._—As th’ life ov a mon.

    One likes to see hearty folk wortchin’,
      An’ weary folk havin’ a rest;
    One likes to yer poor women singin’
      To th’ little things laid o’ their breast;
    Good cooks are my favourite doctors;
      Good livers my parsons shall be;
    An’ ony poor craytur ’at’s clemmin,
      May come have a meawthful wi’ me.

          _Chorus._—As th’ life ov a mon.

    Owd Time,—he’s a troublesome codger,—
      Keeps nudgin’ us on to decay,
    An’ whispers, “Yo’re nobbut a lodger:
      Get ready for goin’ away;”
    Then let’s ha’ no skulkin’ nor sniv’lin’,
      Whatever misfortins befo’,
    God bless him that fends for his livin’,
      An’ houds up his yed through it o’!

          _Chorus._—As th’ life ov a mon.

COME, MARY, LINK THI ARM I’ MINE.


    Come, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine,
      An’ lilt away wi’ me;
    An’ dry that little drop o’ brine,
      Fro’ th’ corner o’ thi e’e;
    Th’ mornin’ dew i’th’ heather-bell’s
      A bonny gem o’ weet;
    That tear a different story tells,—
      It pains my heart to see’t.

          So, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine.

    No lordly ho’ o’th’ country-side’s
      So welcome to my view,
    As th’ little cottage where abides
      My sweetheart, kind an’ true;
    But, there’s a nook beside yon spring,
      An’ iv thae’ll share’t wi’ me;
    Aw’ll buy tho th’ prattist gowden ring
      That ever theaw did see!

          So, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine.

    My feyther’s gan mo forty peawnd,
      I’ silver an’ i’ gowd;
    An’ a bonny bit o’ garden greawnd,
      O’th’ mornin’ side o’th’ fowd;
    An’ a honsome bible, clen an’ new,
      To read for days to come;—
    There’s leaves for writin’ names in, too,
      Like th’ owd un at’s awhoam.

          So, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine.

    Eawr Jenny’s bin a-buyin’ in,
      An’ every day hoo brings
    Knives an’ forks, an’ pots; or irons
      For smoothin’ caps an’ things;
    My gronny’s sent a chist o’ drawers,
      Sunday clooas to keep;
    An’ little Fanny’s bought a glass
      For thee an’ me to peep.

          So, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine.

    Eawr Tum has sent a bacon-flitch;
      Eawr Jem a load o’ coals;
    Eawr Charlie’s bought some pickters, an’
      He’s hanged ’em upo’ th’ woles;
    Owd Posy’s white-weshed th’ cottage through;
      Eawr Matty’s made it sweet;
    An Jack’s gan mo his Jarman flute,
      To play by th’ fire at neet!

          So, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine.

    There’s cups an’ saucers; porritch-pons,
      An’ tables, greyt an’ smo’;
    There’s brushes, mugs, an’ ladin-cans;
      An eight days’ clock an’ o’;
    There’s a cheer for thee, an’ one for me,
      An’ one i’ every nook;
    Thi mother’s has a cushion on’t—
      It’s th’ nicest cheer i’th’ rook.

          So, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine.

    My mother’s gan me th’ four-post bed,
      Wi’ curtains to’t an’ o’;
    An’ pillows, sheets, an’ bowsters, too,
      As white as driven snow;
    It isn’t stuffed wi’ fither-deawn;
      But th’ flocks are clen an’ new;
    Hoo says there’s daycent folk i’th’ teawn
      That’s made a warse un do.

          So, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine.

    Aw peeped into my cot last neet;
      It made me hutchin’ fain:
    A bonny fire were winkin’ breet
      I’ every window-pane;
    Aw marlocked upo’ th’ white hearth-stone,
      An’ drummed o’th’ kettle lid,
    An’ sung, “My neest is snug an’ sweet,
      Aw’ll go and fotch my brid!”

          So, Mary, link thi arm i’ mine.

CHIRRUP.


    Young Chirrup wur a mettled cowt:
      His heart an’ limbs wur true;
    At foot race, or at wrostlin’-beawt,
      Or aught he buckled to
    At wark or play, reet gallantly
      He laid into his game:
    An’ he’re very fond o’ singing-brids—
      That’s heaw he geet his name.

    He’re straight as ony pickin’-rod,
      An’ limber as a snig:
    He’re th’ heartist cock o’ th’ village clod,
      At every country rig:
    His shinin’ e’en wur clear an’ blue;
      His face wur frank an’ bowd;
    An’ th’ yure abeawt his monly broo
      Wur crispt i’ curls o’ gowd.

    Young Chirrup donned his clinker’t shoon,
      An’ startin’ off to th’ fair,
    He swore by th’ leet o’th’ harvest moon,
      He’d have a marlock there;
    He poo’d a sprig fro th’ hawthorn-tree,
      That blossomed by the way;—
    “Iv ony mon says wrang to me,
      Aw’ll tan his hide to-day!”

    Full sorely mony a lass would sigh,
      That chanced to wander near,
    An’ peep into his e’en to spy
      Iv love were lurkin’ theer:
    So fair an’ free he stept o’th green,
      An’ trollin’ eawt a song,
    Wi’ leetsome heart, an’ twinklin’ e’en,
      Went chirrupin’ along.

    Young Chirrup woo’d a village maid,—
      An’ hoo wur th’ flower ov o’,—
    Wi’ kisses kind, i’th’ woodlan’ shade,
      An’ whispers soft an’ low;
    I’ Matty’s ear twur th’ sweetest chime
      That ever mortal sung;
    An’ Matty’s heart beat pleasant time
      To th’ music of his tung.

    Oh, th’ kindest mates, this world within,
      Mun sometimes meet wi’ pain;
    But, if this pair could life begin,
      They’d buckle to again;
    For, though he’re hearty, blunt, an’ tough,
      An’ Matty sweet an’ mild;
    For three-score year, through smooth an’ rough,
      Hoo led him like a child.

THE DULE’S I’ THIS BONNET O’ MINE.


    The dule’s i’ this bonnet o’ mine;
      My ribbins’ll never be reet;
    Here, Mally, aw’m like to be fine,
      For Jamie’ll be comin’ to neet;
    He met me i’th’ lone tother day,—
      Aw’re gooin’ for wayter to th’ well,—
    An’ he begged that aw’d wed him i’ May;—
      Bi’th mass, iv he’ll let me, aw will!

    When he took my two honds into his,
      Good Lord, heaw they trembled between;
    An’ aw durstn’t look up in his face,
      Becose on him seein’ my e’en;
    My cheek went as red as a rose;—
      There’s never a mortal can tell
    Heaw happy aw felt; for, thea knows,
      One couldn’t ha’ axed him theirsel’.

    But th’ tale wur at th’ end o’ my tung,—
      To let it eawt wouldn’t be reet,—
    For aw thought to seem forrud wur wrung,
      So aw towd him aw’d tell him to-neet;
    But, Mally, thae knows very weel,—
      Though it isn’t a thing one should own,—
    Iv aw’d th’ pikein’ o’th world to mysel’,
      Aw’d oather ha’ Jamie or noan.

    Neaw, Mally, aw’ve towd tho my mind;
      What would to do iv ’twur thee?
    “Aw’d tak him just while he’re inclined,
      An’ a farrantly bargain he’d be;
    For Jamie’s as gradely a lad
      As ever stept eawt into th’ sun;—
    Go, jump at thy chance, an’ get wed,
      An’ may th’ best o’th job when it’s done!”

    Eh, dear, but it’s time to be gwon,—
      Aw shouldn’t like Jamie to wait;
    Aw connut for shame be to soon,
      An’ aw wouldn’t for th’ world be to late;
    Aw’m o’ ov a tremble to th’ heel,—
      Dost think at my bonnet’ll do?—
    “Be off, lass,—thae looks very weel;
      He wants noan o’th bonnet, thae foo!”

[Illustration]




TICKLE TIMES.


    Here’s Robin, he looks very gloomy;
      An’ Jamie keeps starin’ at th’ greawnd;
    An’ thinkin’ o’th table at’s empty,
      An’ th’ little things yammerin’ reawnd;
    It’s true, that it’s dark just afore us,—
      But, keep your hearts eawt o’ your shoon,—
    Though clouds may be thickenin’ o’er us,
      There’s lots o’ blue sky up aboon!

    But, when a mon’s honestly willin’
      To wortch, an’ it connot be had;
    And clemmin’ for want ov a shillin’,—
      No wonder ’at he should be sad;
    It troubles his heart to keep seein’,
      His little brids feedin’ o’th air;
    An’ it feels very hard to be deein’,
      An’ never a mortal to care.

    But life’s sich a quare bit o’ travel,—
      A marlock wi’ sun an’ wi’ shade,—
    An’ then, on a bowster o’ gravel,
      They lay’n us i’ bed wi’ a spade;
    It’s no use a peawtin’ an’ fratchin’—
      As th’ whirligig’s twirlin’ areawnd,
    Have at it again; an’ keep scratchin’
      As lung as your yed’s aboon greawnd.

    Iv one could but grope i’th inside on’t,
      There’s trouble i’ every heart;
    An’ thoose that’n th’ biggest o’th pride on’t,
      Oft leeten o’th keenest o’th’ smart.
    Whatever may chance to come to us,
      Let’s may th’ best we con ov e’r share,—
    For there’s mony a fine suit o’ clooas
      That covers a terrible care.

    There’s danger i’ every station,—
      I’th’ palace as mich as i’th cot;
    There’s hanker i’ every condition,
      An’ canker i’ every lot;
    There’s folk that are weary o’ livin’,
      That never fear’t hunger nor cowd;
    An’ there’s mony a miserly nowmun
      At’s deed ov a surfeit o’ gowd.

    One feels, neaw at times are so nippin’,
      A mon’s at a troublesome schoo’,
    That slaves like a horse for a livin’,
      An’ flings it away like a foo;
    But, as pleasur’s sometimes a misfortin’,
      An’ trouble sometimes a good thing,—
    Though we livin’ o’th’ floor same as layrocks,
      We’n go up, like layrocks, to sing!

JAMIE’S FROLIC.


    One neet aw crope whoam when my weighvin’ were o’er,
    To brush mo, an’ wesh mo, an’ fettle my yure;
    Then, trailin’ abeawt, wi’ my heart i’ my shoon,
    Kept tryin’ my hond at a bit ov a tune;
          As Mally sit rockin’,
          An’ darnin’ a stockin’,
      An’ tentin’ her bakin’ i’th’ oon.

    Th’ chylt were asleep, an’ my clooas were reet;
    Th’ baggin’ were ready, an’ o’ lookin’ sweet;
    But aw’re mazy, an’ nattle, an’ fasten’t to tell
    What the dule it could be that’re ailin’ mysel’;
          An’ it made me so naught,
          That, o’ someheaw, aw thought,
      “Aw could just like a snap at eawr Mall.”

    Poor lass, hoo were kinder becose aw were quare;
    “Come, Jamie, an’ sattle thisel in a cheer;
    Thae’s looked very yonderly mony a day;
    It’s grievin’ to see heaw thae’rt wearin’ away,
          An’ trailin’ abeawt,
          Like a hen at’s i’th meawt;
      Do, pritho, poo up to thi tay!

    “Thae wants some new flannels; thae’s getten a cowd
    Thae’rt noather so ugly, my lad, nor so owd;
    But, thae’rt makin’ thisel’ into nought but a slave,
    Wi’ weighvin’, an’ thinkin’, an’ tryin’ to save;—
          Get summat to heyt,
          Or thae’ll go eawt o’ seat,—
      For thae’rt wortchin thisel’ into th’ grave.”

    Thinks I, “Th’ lass’s reet, an’ aw houd wi’ her wit;”
    So aw said—for aw wanted to cheer her a bit—
    “Owd crayter, aw’ve noan made my mind up to dee,
    A frolic’ll just be the physic for me!
          Aw’ll see some fresh places,
          An’ look at fresh faces—
      An’ go have a bit ov a spree!”

    Then, bumpin’ an’ splashin’ her kettle went deawn;
    “I’th name o’ good Katty, Jem, wheer arto beawn?
    An’ what sort o’ faces dost want—con to tell?
    Aw deawt thae’rt for makin’ a foo o’ thisel’,—
          The dule may tent th’ o’on,
          Iv aw go witheawt shoon,
      Aw’ll see where thae gwos to mysel’!”

    Thinks I, “Th’ fat’s i’th fire,—aw mun make it no wur,—
    For there’s plenty o’ feightin’ to do eawt o’th dur;
    So, aw’ll talk very prattily to her, as heaw,
    Or else hoo’ll have houd o’ my toppin’ in neaw;”
          An’ bith’ leet in her e’en,
          It were fair to be sin
      That hoo’re ready to rive me i’ teaw.

    Iv truth mun be towd, aw began to be fain
    To study a bit o’ my cwortin’ again;
    So aw said to her, “Mally, this world’s rough enoo!
    To fo’ eawt wi’ thoose one likes best, winnut do,—
          It’s a very sore smart,
          An’ it sticks long i’th heart,”—
      An’, egad, aw said nought but what’s true!

    Lord, heaw a mon talks when his heart’s in his tung!
    Aw roos’t her, poor lass, an’ aw show’d hoo wur wrung,
    Till hoo took mo bith hond, with a tear in her e’e,
    An’ said, “Jamie, there’s noabry as tender as thee!
          Forgi mo, lad, do:
          For aw’m nobbut a foo,—
      An’ bide wi’ mo, neaw, till aw dee!”

    So, we’n bide one another, whatever may come;
    For there’s no peace i’th world iv there’s no peace awhoam;
    An’ neaw, when a random word gies her some pain,
    Or makes her a little bit crossish i’th grain,
          Sunshine comes back,
          As soon as aw crack
      O’ beginning my cwortin again.

OWD PINDER.


    Owd Pinder were a rackless foo,
      An’ spent his days i’ spreein’;
    At th’ end ov every drinkin’-do,
      He’re sure to crack o’ deein’;
    “Go, sell my rags, an’ sell my shoon;
      Aw’s never live to trail ’em;
    My ballis-pipes are eawt o’ tune,
      An’ th’ wynt begins to fail ’em!”

    “Eawr Matty’s very fresh an’ yung;
      ’Twould ony mon bewilder;
    Hoo’ll wed again afore it’s lung,
      For th’ lass is fond o’ childer;
    My bit o’ brass’ll fly,—yo’n see,—
      When th’ coffin-lid has screened me;
    It gwos again my pluck to dee,
      An’ lev her wick beheend me.”

    “Come, Matty, come, an’ cool my yed,
      Aw’m finished, to my thinkin’;”
    Hoo happed him nicely up, an’ said,
      “Thae’s brought it on wi’ drinkin’!”—
    “Nay, nay,” said he, “my fuddle’s done;
      We’re partin’ t’one fro’ t’other;
    So, promise me that when aw’m gwon,
      Thea’ll never wed another!”

    “Th’ owd tale,” said hoo, an’ laft her stoo,
      “It’s rayley past believin’;
    Thee think o’th’ world thea’rt goin’ to,
      An’ leave this world to th’ livin’;
    What use to me can deead folk be?
      Thae’s kilt thisel’ wi’ spreein’;
    An’ iv that’s o’ thae wants wi’ me,
      Get forrud wi’ thi deein’!”

    He scrat his yed, he rubbed his e’e,
      An’ then he donned his breeches;
    “Eawr Matty gets as fause,” said he,
      “As one o’ Pendle witches;
    Iv ever aw’m to muster wit,
      It mun be now or never;
    Aw think aw’ll try to live a bit;
      It wouldn’t do to lev her!”

COME, JAMIE, LET’S UNDO THI SHOON.


    Come, Jamie, let’s undo thi shoon,
      An’ don summat dry o’ thi feet;
    Wi’ toilin’ i’th sheaw’r up an’ deawn;
      Aw’m fleyed at thi stockins are weet;
    An’, here, wi’ my yung uns i’th neest,
      Aw bin heark’nin’ th’ patter o’th’ rain,
    An’ longin’ for th’ wanderin’ brid,
      To comfort my spirits again.

    To-day, when it pelted at th’ height,
      “Aw’ll ston it no longer,” said I;
    An’, rayley, it didn’t look reet
      To keawer under cover so dry;
    So, though it were rainin’ like mad,
      Aw thought—for my heart gav’ a swell,—
    “Come deawn asto will, but yon lad
      Shall not have it o’ to hissel’!”

    So, whippin’ my bucket i’th rain,
      Aw ga’ th’ bits o’ windows a swill;
    An’, though aw geet drenched to my skin,
      Aw’re better content wi’ mysel’;
    But, theaw stons theer smilin’ o’th floor,
      Like a sun-fleawer drippin’ wi’ weet;
    Eh, Jamie, theaw knowsn’t, aw’m sure,
      Heaw fain aw’m to see tho to-neet!

    Why lass; what’s a sheawer to me?
      Wi’ plenty o’ sun in his breast,
    One’s wark keeps one hearty an’ free,
      An’ gi’s one a relish for rest;
    Aw’m noan made o’ sugar nor saut,
      That melts wi’ a steepin’ o’ rain;
    An’, as for my jacket,—it’s nought,—
      Aw’ll dry it by th’ leet o’ thi e’en!

    So, sit tho deawn close by my side,—
      Aw’m full as a cricket wi’ glee;
    Aw’m trouble’t wi’ nothin’ but pride,
      An’ o’ on it owin’ to thee;
    Theaw trim little pattern for wives;—
      Come, give a poor body a kiss!
    Aw wish every storm ov e’r lives
      May end up as nicely as this!

TH’ GOBLIN PARSON.


    Th’ wynt wur still i’th shade o’th hill,
      An’ stars began o’ glowin’
    I’th’ fadin’ leet, one summer neet,
      When th’ dew wur softly foin’;
    Wi’ weary shanks, by primrose banks,
      Where rindlin’ weet wur shinin’,
    Aw whistle’t careless, wanderin’ slow
      Toward my cot inclinin’.

    Through th’ woodlan’ green aw tooted keen,
      For th’ little window winkin’;—
    Th’ stars may shine, they’re noan as fine
      As Matty’s candle blinkin’;
    O’er th’ rosy hedge aw went to th’ ridge
      O’th lonesome-shaded plantin’,
    To get another blink o’ th’ leet
      That set my heart a-pantin’.

    Then deawn bi’th well i’th fairy-dell,
      Wi’ trees aboon it knittin’,
    Where, near an’ fur, ther nowt astur
      But bats i’th eawl-leet flittin’;
    An’ fearfo’ seawnds that rustle’t reawnd
      Wi’ mony a goblin-twitter,
    As swarmin’ dark to flaysome wark
      They flew wi’ hellish titter.

    There, reet anent aw geet a glent
      At brought a shiver o’er mo,
    For, fair i’th track ther summat black
      Coom creepin’ on afore mo;
    It wur not clear, but it wur theer,—
      Wi’ th’ gloomy shadow blendin’,
    Neaw black an’ slim, neaw grey an’ grim,
      Wi’ noather side nor endin’.

    Cowd drops wur tremblin’ o’ my broo,
      As there aw stood belated;—
    Aw durstn’t turn, nor durstn’t goo,
      But shut my e’en, an’ waited;
    An’ just as aw begun to pray,
      There coom fro’ th’ creepin’ spectre
    A weel known seawnd that said, “Well, James!”—
      ’Twur nowt but th’ village rector.

    “Well, James,” said he, “I’m fain to see
      Yo’r pew so weel attended;
    But then, yo shouldn’t fo’ asleep
      Afore my sarmon’s ended:
    To dreawsy ears it’s useless quite
      To scatter holy teychin’:
    Why don’t yo bring a bit o’ snuff,
      An’ tak it while I’m preychin’.”

    “Well, well,” said aw, “There’s mony a way
      O’ keepin’ e’en fro’ closin’;
    A needle would keep th’ body wake,
      An’ th’ soul met still be dozin’;
    But this receipt would set it reet,
      Iv th’ mixture wur a warm un,—
    Yo’m get some stingin’ gospel-snuff,
      An’ put it into th’ sarmon.”

    He stare’t like mad, but th’ good owd lad
      Then grip’t my hond, warm-hearted,
    An’ said, “Yo’re reet, yo’re reet—good neet!”
      An’ that wur heaw we parted.
    It touched my heart, an’ made it smart,
      He spoke so mild and pratty;
    Aw blest him as he walked away,
      An’ then went whoam to Matty.

WHILE TAKIN’ A WIFT O’ MY PIPE.


    While takin’ a wift o’ my pipe tother neet,
      A thowt trickled into my pate,
    That sulkin’ becose everything isn’t sweet,
      Is nought but a foolish consate;
    Iv mon had bin made for a bit of a spree,
      An’ th’ world were a marlockin’ schoo’,
    Wi’ nought nobbut heytin’, an’ drinkin’, an’ glee,
      An’ haliday gam to go through,
          He’d sicken afore
          His frolic were o’er,
      An’ feel he’d bin born for a foo’.

    Poor crayter, he’s o’ discontentment an’ deawt,
      Whatever his fortin may be;
    He’s just like a chylt at goes cryin’ abeawt,
      “Eawr Johnny’s moor traycle nor me;”
    One minute he’s trouble’t, next minute he’s fain,
      An’ then, they’re so blended i’ one,
    It’s hard to tell whether he’s laughin’ through pain,
      Or whether he’s peawtin’ for fun;—
          He stumbles, an’ grumbles,
          He struggles, an’ juggles,—
      He capers a bit,—an’ he’s gone.

           *       *       *       *       *

    It’s wise to be humble i’ prosperous ways,
      For trouble may chance to be nee;
    It’s wise for to struggle wi’ sorrowful days
      Till sorrow breeds sensible glee;
    He’s rich that, contented wi’ little, lives weel,
      An’ nurses his little to moor;
    He’s weel off ’at’s rich, iv he nobbut can feel
      He’s brother to thoose that are poor;
          An’ to him ’at does fair,
          Though his livin’ be bare,
      Some comfort shall olez be sure.

    We’n nobbut a lifetime a-piece here below,
      An’ th’ lungest is very soon spent;
    There’s summat aboon measur’s cuts for us o’,
      An’ th’ most on ’em nobbut a fent;
    Lung or short, rough or fine, little matter for that,
      We’n make th’ best o’th stuff till it’s done,
    An’ when it leets eawt to get rivven a bit,
      Let’s darn it as weel as we con;
          When th’ order comes to us
          To doff these owd clooas,
      There’ll surely be new uns to don.

GOD BLESS THI SILVER YURE!


    Jone, lad, though thi hond’s
      Like reawsty iron to feel,
    There’s very few i’th lond
      Aw like to gripe as weel.
    Thae’ll never dee i’th dumps
      Becose o’ bein’ poor,
    Thae good owd king o’ trumps,—
      God bless thi silver yure!

    Poo up to th’ side o’th hob,
      An’ rest thi weary shanks,
    An’ dunnot fret thy nob
      Wi’ fortin’ an’ her pranks;
    These folk at’s preawd an’ rich
      May tremble at her freawn,
    They’n further far nor sich
      As thee to tumble deawn.

    Theaw never longs for wine,
      Nor dainties rich an’ rare.
    For sich a life as thine
      Can sweeten simple fare;
    Contented wi’ thi meal,
      Thae’s wit enough to know
    That daisies liven weel
      Where tulips connot grow.

    An’ though thi cloas are rough,
      An’ gettin’ very owd,
    They’n onswer weel enough
      To keep thi limbs fro’ th’ cowd;
    A foo would pine away
      I’ such a suit as thine,
    But, thaer’t the stuff to may
      A fustian jacket fine.

    A tattered clowt may lap
      A very noble prize;
    A king may be, by hap,
      A beggar i’ disguise.
    When t’one has laft his feast,
      An’ t’other done his crust,
    Then, which is which at last,—
      These little piles o’ dust?

    An’ though thy share o’ life,
      May seem a losin’ game,
    Thae’s striven fair i’th strife,
      An’ kept a daycent aim;
    No meawse-nooks i’ thi mind,
      No malice i’ thi breast,
    Thae’s still bin true an’ kind,
      An’ trusted fate wi’ th’ rest.

    Through trouble, toil, an’ wrung,
      Thae’s whistle’t at thi wark,
    An’ wrostle’t life so lung,
      Thi limbs are gettin stark;
    But, sich a heart as thine’s
      A never-failin’ friend;
    It cheer’s a mon’s decline,
      An’ keeps it sweet to th’ end.

    Thy banner’ll soon be furled,
      An’ then they’n ha’ to tell,
    “He travell’t th’ dirty world,
      An’ never soil’t hissel’!”
    An’ when aw come to dee,
      An’ death has ta’en his tow,
    Aw hope to leet o’ thee,—
      God bless thi snowy pow!

MARGIT’S COMIN’.

AIR—“_Th’ Rakes o’ Mellor_.”


    Eh! Sam, whatever doesto meeon;
    Aw see thae’rt theer i’th nook again;
    Where aw’ve a gill thae’s nine or ten:
      Thae mun have heir’t a fortin!
    Aw wonder heaw a mon can sit
    An’ waste his bit o’ wage an’ wit:
    If aw’re thi wife aw’d make tho flit,
      Wi’ little time to start in.

    But, houd; yor Margit’s up i’th teawn;

    Thae knows yor Margit weel ov owd;

      Aw’ll swear aw never sin tho.

    Aw’ll bite my tung aw will, bith mon,
    An’ plug my ears up till hoo’s gwon;
    A grooin’ tree could hardly ston
      A savage woman flytin’;
    Iv folk were nobbut o’ i’th mind
    To make their bits o’ booses kind,
    There’d be less wanderin’ eawt to find
      A corner to be quiet in.

    It’s nearly three o’clock bith chime:
    This ale o’ Jem’s is very prime;
    Aw’ll keawer mo deawn till baggin-time,

    An’ Liltin’ Jenny’s getten wed;

      But that’s not mich to crack o’.

    There’s news that chaps ’at wore a creawn,
    Are gettin’ powler’t up an’ deawn,
    They’re puncin’ ’em fro teawn to teawn,
      Like foot-bo’s in a pastur;

EAWR FOLK.


    Eawr Johnny gi’s his mind to books;
      Eawr Abram studies plants,—
    He caps the dule for moss an’ ferns,
      An’ grooin’ polyants;
    For aught abeawt mechanickin’,
      Eawr Ned’s the very lad;
    My uncle Jamie roots i’th stars,
      Enough to drive him mad.

    Eawr Alick keeps a badger’s shop,
      An’ teyches Sunday schoo’;
    Eawr Joseph’s welly blynt, poor lad;
      Eawr Timothy’s—a foo’;—
    He’s tried three different maks o’ trades,
      An’ olez missed his tip;
    But, then, he’s th’ nicest whistler
      That ever cocked a lip!

    Eawr Matty helps my mother, an’
      Hoo sews, an’ tents eawr Joe;
    At doin’ sums, an’ sich as that,
      My feyther licks ’em o’!
    Eawr Charley,—eh, there connot be
      Another pate like his;
    It’s o’ crom-full o’ ancientry,
      An’ Roman haw-pennies!

    Eawr Tummy’s taen to preitchin’,—
      He’s a topper at it, too!
    But then,—what’s th’ use,—eawr Bill comes in
      An’ swears it winnut do:
    When t’one’s bin strivin’ o’ he con
      To awter wicked men,
    Then t’other mays some marlocks, an
      Convarts ’em o’er again.

    Eawr Abel’s th’ yung’st; an’ next to Joe,
      My mother likes him t’ best;
    Hoo gi’s him brass, aboon his share,
      To keep him nicely drest;—
    He’s gettin in wi’ th’ quality,
      An’ when his clarkin’s done,
    He’s olez oather cricketin’,
      Or shootin’ wi’ a gun.

    My uncle Sam’s a fiddler; an’
      Aw fain could yer him play
    Fro’ set o’ sun till winter neet
      Had melted into day;
    For eh,—sich glee!—sich tenderness!
      Through every changin’ part,
    It’s th’ heart ’at stirs his fiddle,—
      An’ his fiddle stirs his heart.

    When th’ owd brid touches th’ tremblin’ streng,
      It knows his thowt so weel,
    It seawnds as iv an angel tried
      To tell what angels feel;
    An’, sometimes, th’ water in his e’en,
      ’At fun has made to flow,
    Can hardly roll away, afore
      It’s weet wi’ drops o’ woe.

    Then, here’s to Jone, an’ Ab, an’ Ned,

TH’ SWEETHEART GATE.

AIR—“_The Manchester Angel_.”


    Oh, there’s mony a gate eawt ov eawr teawn-end,
      But nobbut one for me;
    It winds by a rindlin’ wayter side,
      An’ o’er a posied lea.
    It wanders into a shady dell;
      An’ when aw’ve done for th’ day,
    Aw never can sattle this heart o’ mine,
      Beawt walkin’ deawn that way.

    It’s noather garden, nor posied lea,
      Nor wayter rindlin’ clear;
    But deawn i’th vale there’s a rosy nook,
      An’ my true love lives theer.
    It’s olez summer where th’ heart’s content,
      Tho’ wintry winds may blow;
    An’ there’s never a gate ’at’s so kind to th’ fuut,
      As th’ gate one likes to go.

    When aw set off o’ sweetheartin’, aw’ve
      A theawsan’ things to say;
    But th’ very first glent o’ yon chimbley-top
      It drives ’em o’ away;
    An’ when aw meet wi’ my bonny lass,
      It sets my heart a-jee;—
    Oh, there’s summut i’th leet o’ yon two blue e’en
      That plays the dule wi’ me!

    When th’ layrock’s finished his wark aboon,
      An’ laid his music by,
    He flutters deawn to his mate, an’ stops
      Till dayleet stirs i’th sky.
    Though Matty sends me away at dark,
      Aw know that hoo’s reet full well;—
    An’ it’s heaw aw love a true-hearted lass,
      No mortal tung can tell!

    Aw wish that Candlemas day were past,
      When wakin’ time comes on;
    An’ aw wish that Kesmass time were here,
      An Matty an’ me were one.
    Aw wish this wanderin’ wark were o’er—
      This maunderin’ to an’ fro;
    That aw could go whoam to my own true love,
      An’ stop at neet an’ o’.

GENTLE JONE.

AIR—“_Jenny’s Bawbee_.”


    I seed a thowtful chap one day,
    His face were mild, his toppin grey;
    Wi’ wanderin’ fuut he went astray,
                Deawn yon lone.
    I axed a lame owd mon i’th road,
    To tell me what that chap were co’d;
    Says he, “I thowt oitch body knowed
                Gentle Jone.”

    “Owd lad,” said I, “just look heaw ronk
    These daisies groo’n at th’ edge o’th bonk;
    Let’s keawer us deawn, an’ have a conk,
                Just whol noon.”
    He poo’d a reech o’ bacco eawt,
    An’ cheese an’ mouffin in a cleawt;
    An’ thus began to tell abeawt
                Gentle Jone.

    Says he, “Some chaps o’ brass are fond;
    They’re trouble’t sore wi’ cramp i’th hond;
    But yon’s the fleawer ov o’ this lond,—
                Gentle Jone!
    His heart’s as true as guinea-gowd
    He’s good to folk at’s ill an’ owd;
    Childer poo’n his lap i’th fowd,—
                Gentle Jone!

    “I’ll bet a groat he’s off to th’ vale,
    Just neaw, to yer some soory tale;
    I never knowed his kindness fail,—
                Gentle Jone!
    O’er hill, an’ cloof, an’ moss, an’ moor,
    He’s reet weel known to folk at’s poor,
    A welcome fuut at every door,—
                Gentle Jone!

    “He taks delight i’ roving reawnd,
    To nooks where trouble’s mostly feawnd;
    He comes like rain to drufty greawnd,—
                Gentle Jone!
    He’s very slow at thinkin’ ill;
    Forgi’s a faut wi’ hearty will;
    An’ doin’ good’s his pastime still,—
                Gentle Jone!

    “At th’ time I broke this poor owd limb,
    I should ha’ dee’d except for him.”
    He said no moor; his e’en geet dim,—
                Mine were th’ same.
    “Owd lad,” said I, “Come, have a gill!”
    “Naw, naw,” said he, “I’m rayther ill;
    It’s time to paddle deawn this hill,
                To th’ owd dame.”

    ’Twere nearly noon, i’th month o’ May;
    We said we’d meet some other day;
    An’ then th’ owd crayter limped away
                Deawn th’ green lone.
    An’ neaw, let’s do the thing that’s reet,
    An’ then, when death puts eawt e’r leet,
    We’s haply ston a chance to meet
                Gentle Jone!

NEET-FO’.

OLD AIR—“_When Dolly and I get wed_.”


    Th’ wynt blows keen thro’ th’ shiverin’ thorn,
      An’ th’ leet looks wild i’th sky;
    Come, Tet, stir up that fire, an’ draw
      That keyther gently by;
    Aw’ve done my weshin’, gronny; an’
      Aw’ve tidied every thing;
    An’ neaw aw’ll sit me deawn to sew,
      An’ hearken th’ kettle sing.

    Bring in some coals; an’ shut that dur,—
      It’s quite a wintry day;
    Reitch deawn that ham; eawr Robin likes
      A relish to his tay.
    Sweep th’ grate, an’ set this table eawt;
      Put th’ tay-pot upo’ th’ oon;
    It’s gettin’ on for baggin’ time,
      An’ he’ll be comin’ soon.

    Th’ fire bruns clear; an’ th’ heawse begins,
      A-lookin’ brisk an’ breet,
    As th’ time draws near when he gets back,
      Fro’ th’ teawn at th’ edge o’ neet;
    It makes one hutch wi’ glee to yer
      A favourite fuut come whoam;
    An’ it’s very fine to hearken, when
      One knows its sure to come

    Th’ cat pricks up her ears at th’ sneck,
      Wi’ mony a leetsome toot;
    An’ th’ owd arm-cheer i’th corner seems,
      As if it yerd his fuut;
    Th’ window blinks; an’ th’ clock begins
      A-tickin’ leawd an’ fain;
    An’ th’ tin things winkin’ upo’ th’ wole,—
      They groon as breet again.

    Th’ kettle’s hummin’ o’er wi’ fun—
      Just look at th’ end o’th speawt;
    It’s like some little sooty lad
      At’s set his lips to sheawt.
    Yon wayter-drops at fo’n fro’ th’ tap,
      Are gettin’ wick wi’ glee;
    An yo’re fain, gronny, too, aw know,—
      But noan as fain as me.

    Keep th’ rockers gooin’ soft an’ slow,
      An’ shade that leet away;
    Aw think this little duck’s o’th mend;
      Hoo sleeps so weel to-day;
    Doze on, my darlin’; keep ’em shut,—
      Those teeny windows blue;
    Good Lord! iv aught should happen thee,
      What could thi mother do!

    Here, gronny, put this cover on,
      An’ tuck it nicely in;
    Keep th’ keyther stirrin’ gently; an’
      Make very little din.
    An’ lap thoose dimpled honds away
      Fro’ th’ frosty winter air;
    They lie’n a-top o’ th’ bit o’ quilt,
      Like two clock-hommers theer.

    But stop; hoo’s laughin’! come, hie up;
      My bonny little puss!
    God bless it! Daddy’s noan far off;
      Let mammy have a buss!
    He’s here! He’s here! Tet, bring that cheer!
      Eh, dear; these darlin’s two!
    Iv it wur not for this chylt an’ him,
      What could a body do!

AW’VE WORN MY BITS O’ SHOON AWAY.


    Aw’ve worn my bits o’ shoon away,
      Wi’ roving up an’ deawn,
    To see yon moorlan’ valleys, an’
      Yon little country teawn:
    The dule tak shoon, and stockins too!
      My heart feels warm an’ fain;
    An’, if aw trudge it bar-fuut, lads,
      Aw’ll see yon teawn again!

    It’s what care I for cities grand,—
      We never shall agree;
    Aw’d rayther live where th’ layrock sings,—
      A country teawn for me!
    A country teawn, where one can meet
      Wi’ friends, an’ neighbours known;
    Where one can lounge i’th market-place,
      An’ see the meadows mown.

    Yon rollin’ hills are very fine,
      At th’ end o’ sweet July;
    Yon woodlan’ cloofs, an valleys green,—
      The bonnist under th’ sky;
    Yon dainty rindles, dancin’ deawn
      Fro’ th’ meawntains into th’ plain;—
    As soon as th’ new moon rises, lads,
      Aw’m off to th’ moors again!

    There’s jolly lads among yon hills,
      An’ in yon country teawn;
    They’n far moor sense than preawder folk,—
      Aw’ll peawnd it for a creawn;
    They’re wick an’ warm at wark an’ fun,
      Wherever they may go,—
    The primest breed o’ lads i’th world,—
      Good luck attend ’em o’!

    Last neet aw laft the city thrung,
      An’ climbed yon hillock green;
    An’ sat me deawn to look at th’ hills,
      Wi’ th’ wayter i’ my e’en;—
    Wi’ th’ wayter wellin’ i’ my e’en;—
      Aw’ll bundle up, an’ go,
    An’ live an’ dee i’ my own countrie,
      Where moorlan’ breezes blow!

YESTERNEET.


    I geet up a-milkin’ this mornin’,—
      I geet up afore it wur leet;
    I ne’er slept a minute for thinkin’
      What Robin said yesterneet;
    I’ve brokken two basins i’th dairy;
      I’ve scoaded my gronny wi’ tay;
    It’s no use a tryin’ a-spinnin’—
      My wheel’s eawt o’ trim to-day.

                 _Chorus._

          It’s oh, yon Robin, yon Robin;
            His e’en ne’er twinkle’t so breet,
          As they did when he meazur’t my finger
            For th’ little gowd ring last neet.

    Eawr Dorothy’s singin’ i’th shippon;
      Eawr Jonathan’s leawngin’ i’th fowd;
    Eawr Tummy’s at th’ fair, where he lippens
      O’ swappin’ his cowt for gowd;
    My gronny’s asleep wi’ her knittin’,
      An’ th’ kittlin’s playin’ wi’ th’ yarn;
    Eawr Betty’s gone eawt wi’ a gallon
      To th’ chaps at their wark i’th barn.

    _Chorus_—But oh, yon Robin, yon Robin.

    Th’ lasses an’ lads are i’th meadow;
      They’re gettin’ their baggin’ i’th hay;
    I yer ’em as leetsome as layrocks,
      I’th sky ov a shiny day;
    But, little I care for their marlocks;
      I dunnot want them for to see,
    Though I’m fitter for cryin’ than laughin’,
      There’s nob’dy as fain as me.

    _Chorus_—For oh, yon Robin, yon Robin.

    When I crept into th’ nook wi’ my sewin’,
      My mother looked reawnd so sly;
    Hoo know’d I could see across th’ coppice,
      Where Robin comes ridin’ by;
    Then hoo coom to me, smilin’ an’ tootin’,
      An’ whisperin’, “Heaw doesto feel?
    Dost think I should send for a doctor?”
      But, th’ doctor hoo knows reet weel.

    _Chorus_—It’s nought i’th world but Robin.

    My feyther sits dozin’ i’th corner,
      He’s dreamin’ o’th harvest day;
    When Robin comes in for his daughter,
      Eh, what’ll my feyther say?
    Th’ rosebuds are peepin’ i’th garden;
      An’ th’ blossom’s o’th apple tree;
    Oh, heaw will life’s winter time find us,—
      Yon Robin o’ mine, an’ me?

    _Chorus_—For oh, yon Robin, yon Robin.

    Then, hey for kisses an’ blushes,
      An’ hurryin’ to an’ fro;
    An’ hey for sly, sweet whispers,
      That nob’dy but me mun know!
    Then, hey for rings, an’ ribbins,
      An’ bonnets, an’ posies fine!
    An’ eh,—it’s o’ in a flutter,—
      This little fond heart o’ mine!

                 _Chorus._

        For oh, yon Robin, yon Robin;
          His e’en ne’er twinkle’t so breet,
        As they did when he meazur’t my finger
          For th’ little gowd ring last neet.

      We’n have a roozin’ rant to-day;

      For bonny Nan i’th Owler dale;

      An’ neaw aw’m brisk as bottle’t ale!
          Oh, guess, owd brid,

      Hoo look’d so deawn, wi’ ne’er a smile
    Aw couldn’t find i’ heart or mind
      To cheep o’ weddin’ for a while;
    Aw thought aw’d bide; but still aw sighed
      For th’ mournin’ cleawd to clear away;
    Aw watched her e’en groo breet again,—
      A layrock tootin’ eawt for day!
          Neaw, guess, owd brid,
            What’s beawn to be;
          For I like Nan,—
            An’ hoo likes me!

    Oh, Nanny’s fair, an’ trim, an’ rare;
      A modest lass, an’ sweet to see;
    Her e’en are blue, her heart it’s true,—
      But Nanny’s hardly twenty-three;
    An’ life it’s strung, when folk are yung;
      An’ waitin’ lunger wouldno do;
    For, th’ moor-end lads, hoo turns their yeds,—
      Hoo’s bin a widow lung enoo!
          Then guess, owd brid,
            What’s beawn to be;
          For I like Nan,—
            An’ hoo likes me!

    Aw’ve sin, at neet, abeawt a leet,
      A midge keep buzzin’ to an’ fro,
    Then dart at th’ shine, ’at looked so fine,
      An’ brun his wings at th’ end ov o’;
    That midge’s me, it’s plain to see,
      My wings are brunt, an’ yet aw’m fain,
    For, wheer aw leet, aw find so sweet,
      Aw’s never want to fly again.
          Then guess, owd brid,
            What’s beawn to be;
          For I like Nan,—

A LIFT ON THE WAY.

AIR—“_Come, sit down, my cronies_.”


    Come, what’s th’ use o’ fratchin’, lads, this life’s noan so lung,
    So, iv yo’n gether reawnd, aw’ll try my hond at a sung;
    It may shew a guidin’ glimmer to some wand’rer astray,
    Or, haply, gi’ some poor owd soul a lift on the way.
                          A lift on the way;
                          A lift on the way;
    Or, haply, gi’ some poor owd soul a lift on the way.

    Life’s road’s full o’ ruts; it’s very slutchy, an’ it’s dree;
    An’ mony a worn-eawt limper lies him deawn there to dee;
    Then, fleawnd’rin’ low i’th gutter, he looks reawnd wi’ dismay,
    To see iv aught i’th world can give a lift on the way.
                          A lift on the way;
                          A lift on the way;
    To see iv aught i’th world can give a lift on the way.

    Oh, there’s some folk ’at mun trudge it, an’ there’s some folk ’at
              may ride,
    But, never mortal mon con tell what chance may betide;
    To-day, he may be blossomin’, like roses i’ May;
    To-morn, he may be beggin’ for a lift on the way.
                          A lift on the way;
                          A lift on the way;
    To-morn, he may be beggin’ for a lift on the way.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Good-will, it’s a jewel, where there’s little else to spare;
    An’ a mon may help another though his pouch may be bare;
    A gen’rous heart, like sunshine, brings good cheer in its ray,
    An’ a friendly word can sometimes give a lift on the way.
                          A lift on the way;
                          A lift on the way;
    An’ a friendly word can sometimes give a lift on the way.

    Like posies ’at are parchin’ in the midsummer sun,
    There’s mony a poor heart faints afore the journey be run;
    Then, lay the dust wi’ kindness, till the close of the day,
    An’ gi’ these droopin’ travellers a lift on the way.
                          A lift on the way;
                          A lift on the way;
    An’ gi’ these drooping travellers a lift on the way.

    Oh, soft be his pillow, when he sinks deawn to his rest,
    That can keep the lamp o’ charity alive in his breast;
    May pleasant feelin’s haunt him as he’s dozin’ away,
    An’ angels give him, up aboon, a lift on the way.
                          A lift on the way;
                          A lift on the way;
    An’ angels give him, up aboon, a lift on the way.

    Jog on, my noble comrades, then, an’ so mote it be,—
    That hond in hond we travel till the day we mun dee;
    An’ neaw, to end my ditty, lads, let’s heartily pray
    That heaven may give us ev’ry one a lift on the way.
                          A lift on the way;
                          A lift on the way;
    That heaven may give us ev’ry one a lift on the way.

    Tum Rindle lope fro’ the chimbley nook,

      An’ wastin’ time i’ thinkin’:
    It frets my heart, an’ racks my broo—

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
